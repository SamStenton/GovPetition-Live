A quick and dirty attempt at using the json file provided by the petition.gov website to count votes to the 'Second EU Referendum' and provide a live update website.

Unfortunately I only managed to start capturing the data when the petition was well into the millions so the resulting graph starts quite late.


TODO: 
- Neaten up
- Make it easy to change the petition to check the live count on
